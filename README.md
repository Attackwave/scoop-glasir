# Scoop bucket for Glasir

```powershell
scoop bucket add glasir https://github.com/Attackwave/scoop-glasir
scoop install glasir
```

[Glasir](https://github.com/Attackwave/glasir) is deterministic code intelligence:
a queryable graph of a repository, served to coding assistants over MCP.

`bucket/glasir.json` is written by Glasir's release workflow from the
checksums of each release. Do not edit it by hand; changes belong in
[packaging/render.py](https://github.com/Attackwave/glasir/blob/main/packaging/render.py).
